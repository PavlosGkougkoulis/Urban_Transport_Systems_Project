# Urban Transport Systems Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and improving the public transport system provided by **ASTIKO KTEL Volou** in Volos, Greece. The goal is to identify inefficiencies and key issues within the city's public transport services and propose actionable recommendations to enhance overall service quality and passenger satisfaction. The project leverages data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning techniques to evaluate the performance of the system, understand operational bottlenecks, analyze passenger patterns, and suggest improvements.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Data Analysis Tools**: The project utilizes RStudio and Python to process and analyze key data from various bus lines and stops of ASTIKO KTEL Volou. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover trends and patterns such as peak hours, bus delays, overcrowding, and other operational issues.

2. **Identification of Key Issues**: We use the data to identify major challenges in the public transport system, such as inefficiencies in bus routes, frequent delays, areas with high passenger demand, and under-served locations, particularly in suburban regions. Pinpointing these problems allows for targeted solutions to improve service.

3. **Recommendations for Improvement**: Based on the insights gained from data analysis, we provide actionable recommendations aimed at improving the service. These include optimizing bus schedules, enhancing fleet management, improving frequency during peak hours, and expanding service coverage to underserved areas.

4. **Enhancing Real-time Services**: One of the objectives is to provide real-time data and recommendations to passengers, enabling them to make informed travel decisions. This involves creating data visualizations and interactive dashboards that display live information about bus locations, delays, and estimated arrival times.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following core components:

1. **Code in R and Python**: The repository contains R and Python scripts for analyzing the data, processing key metrics, and visualizing results. The code is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for future improvements or modifications.

2. **Data Analysis Results and Visualizations**: Various plots, graphs, and charts are generated to highlight key metrics such as bus delays, passenger boarding/unboarding counts, average speeds, and bus frequency. These visualizations help present the current performance of the public transport system and identify areas that need attention.

3. **Recommendations Document**: A comprehensive document containing actionable insights and recommendations based on the data analysis. These recommendations are aimed at improving operational efficiency, passenger comfort, and service reliability.

## Goals and Impact

The primary goal of this project is to empower ASTIKO KTEL Volou with data-driven insights that enable informed decision-making. By implementing the recommendations, we aim to:

1.  **Optimize Bus Routes and Schedules**: Improve the planning of bus routes and schedules to ensure better coverage and efficiency, minimizing delays and overcrowding.

2.  **Improve Passenger Experience**: Address issues such as delays and overcrowding to provide passengers with a more comfortable and timely travel experience.

3.  **Enhance Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provide ASTIKO KTEL Volou with a data-driven framework to continuously evaluate and adjust their services, ensuring ongoing improvements.

4.  **Promote Sustainable Urban Mobility**: Contribute to sustainable urban transportation solutions in Volos, supporting long-term, eco-friendly mobility goals.

By successfully implementing the recommendations, this project aims to deliver a more reliable, efficient, and accessible public transport system to the citizens of Volos.

#### Key Impacts:

-**Optimized Bus Routes and Schedules**: Enhanced planning for better service coverage and efficiency.

-**Improved Passenger Experience**: Reduced delays and overcrowding leading to a more comfortable and reliable travel experience.

-**Enhanced Data-Driven Decision Making**: Providing actionable insights to improve daily operations and long-term planning.

-**Sustainable Urban Mobility**: Promoting sustainable transportation options in Volos.
